## Overview

The `config-flow` rule mandates that integrations must be configurable through the Home Assistant UI, providing a user-friendly setup experience. This applies to the `devolo_home_network` integration as it connects to a network device and requires user-provided configuration (IP address and an optional password).

The integration fully complies with this rule.

1.  **Enabling Config Flow:** The `manifest.json` file correctly enables the config flow by setting `"config_flow": true`.

2.  **Implementation:** A `config_flow.py` file is present and implements the `DevoloHomeNetworkConfigFlow` class. This class handles multiple entry points for configuration:
    *   `async_step_user`: For manual setup by the user.
    *   `async_step_zeroconf`: For automatic discovery of devolo devices on the network.
    *   `async_step_reauth`: For handling re-authentication when a password changes or is required.

3.  **User Experience:** The integration provides a good user experience during setup, as stipulated by the rule:
    *   **Input Validation:** The `validate_input` helper function in `config_flow.py` is used to test the connection details before creating the entry. It gracefully handles potential `DeviceNotFound` and `DevicePasswordProtected` exceptions, mapping them to user-friendly error messages like `cannot_connect` and `invalid_auth`.
    *   **Descriptive Text:** The `strings.json` file includes a `data_description` section for the user step, which provides helpful context for the required input fields:
        ```json
        "data_description": {
          "ip_address": "IP address of your devolo Home Network device. This can be found in the devolo Home Network App on the device dashboard.",
          "password": "Password you protected the device with."
        }
        ```
    *   **Data Storage:** The flow correctly stores essential connection information (`ip_address`, `password`) in `ConfigEntry.data`, which is the appropriate place for configuration needed to establish a connection. There are no other settings that would require an options flow, as other features are managed via entities.

The implementation is robust, user-friendly, and adheres to all the requirements of the `config-flow` rule.
