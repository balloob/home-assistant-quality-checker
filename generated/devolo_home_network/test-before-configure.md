## Overview

The `test-before-configure` rule applies to this integration as it connects to a physical device over the local network and therefore needs to validate connection details (IP address, password) before creating a configuration entry.

The `devolo_home_network` integration fully follows this rule. The validation logic is encapsulated in the `validate_input` helper function within `config_flow.py`. This function is called from all relevant config flow steps (`async_step_user`, `async_step_zeroconf_confirm`, and `async_step_reauth_confirm`).

The validation process is robust:
1.  It instantiates the `devolo_plc_api.Device` with the provided IP address.
2.  It attempts to connect to the device using `await device.async_connect(...)`. This will raise an exception like `DeviceNotFound` if the IP address is incorrect or the device is unreachable.
3.  If a password is provided, it attempts a password-protected API call (`await device.device.async_uptime()`) to verify the credentials. This will raise a `DevicePasswordProtected` exception if the password is wrong.

These calls are wrapped in a `try...except` block in the config flow steps. If an exception occurs, it is caught, and a relevant error key is set in the `errors` dictionary (e.g., `errors["base"] = "cannot_connect"` or `errors["base"] = "invalid_auth"`). This dictionary is then used to display an error message to the user on the form, preventing the creation of a non-functional config entry. The entry is only created in the `else` block, which is executed upon successful validation.

**`config_flow.py` (`async_step_user`):**
```python
        if user_input is not None:
            try:
                info = await validate_input(self.hass, user_input)
            except DeviceNotFound:
                errors["base"] = "cannot_connect"
            except DevicePasswordProtected:
                errors["base"] = "invalid_auth"
            except Exception:
                _LOGGER.exception("Unexpected exception")
                errors["base"] = "unknown"
            else:
                # ...
                return self.async_create_entry(title=info[TITLE], data=user_input)

        return self.async_show_form(
            step_id="user", data_schema=STEP_USER_DATA_SCHEMA, errors=errors
        )
```

This implementation is a clear and correct application of the rule, ensuring a good user experience by providing immediate feedback on configuration issues.
