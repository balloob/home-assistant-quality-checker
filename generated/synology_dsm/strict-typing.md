## Overview

The `strict-typing` rule requires integrations to be fully type-annotated to allow for static type checking and improved code reliability. It also recommends adding the integration to the `.strict-typing` file in the Home Assistant core repository to enforce these checks in continuous integration. Additionally, if the integration utilizes `runtime_data`, it must define and use a custom typed `ConfigEntry`.

This integration successfully implements the requirements of the `strict-typing` rule within its codebase:

1.  **Extensive Type Hinting:** The Python files (`__init__.py`, `entity.py`, `coordinator.py`, `config_flow.py`, `service.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `switch.py`, `media_source.py`, `common.py`, `sensor.py`, `repairs.py`, `update.py`, `button.py`, `backup.py`) demonstrate a high level of type annotation for function signatures, variables, and class attributes. This includes complex types and generics, enabling effective static analysis.
2.  **Custom Typed `ConfigEntry` and `runtime_data`:** The integration correctly defines `SynologyDSMData` (`coordinator.py`) and `SynologyDSMConfigEntry = ConfigEntry[SynologyDSMData]`. This custom typed entry is used throughout the codebase (e.g., in `__init__.py`, `coordinator.py`, `entity.py`, `config_flow.py`, `repairs.py`, etc.) wherever the `ConfigEntry` is accessed, ensuring type safety when interacting with `entry.runtime_data`.
3.  **Adherence to Pattern:** The codebase follows the recommended patterns for type-safe code in Home Assistant, including the use of `dataclass` for entity descriptions, type guards (`TYPE_CHECKING`), and appropriate handling of potential `mypy` issues with `type: ignore` comments where necessary (e.g., in binary/switch `is_on` properties which access attributes dynamically via `getattr`).

Based on the provided code, the integration is well-structured and extensively typed according to the requirements of the `strict-typing` rule. While the final step of adding the domain to the `.strict-typing` file in the core repository is necessary for full enforcement via CI (and is outside the scope of this code review), the integration's code itself is compliant.

## Suggestions

No suggestions needed. The integration's code follows the `strict-typing` rule.
