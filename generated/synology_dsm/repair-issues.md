## Overview

The `repair-issues` rule requires integrations to utilize repair issues and associated flows for situations where user intervention is necessary to resolve a problem, ensuring the user is informed and provided actionable steps. The rule also specifies that repair issues should *not* be used for problems the user cannot fix.

The `synology_dsm` integration follows this rule. It implements a specific repair issue and flow for a problem that the user *can* resolve: configuring the backup location.

In `homeassistant/components/synology_dsm/common.py`, a repair issue with the `translation_key` `ISSUE_MISSING_BACKUP_SETUP` is created via `ir.async_create_issue` when the File Station API is available (indicating backup capability) but the `CONF_BACKUP_PATH` option is not set:

```python
            if shares and not self._entry.options.get(CONF_BACKUP_PATH):
                ir.async_create_issue(
                    self._hass,
                    DOMAIN,
                    f"{ISSUE_MISSING_BACKUP_SETUP}_{self._entry.unique_id}",
                    data={"entry_id": self._entry.entry_id},
                    is_fixable=True,
                    is_persistent=False,
                    severity=ir.IssueSeverity.WARNING,
                    translation_key=ISSUE_MISSING_BACKUP_SETUP,
                    translation_placeholders={"title": self._entry.title},
                )
```

This repair issue is explicitly marked as `is_fixable=True` and has a corresponding `RepairsFlow` handler defined in `homeassistant/components/synology_dsm/repairs.py` named `MissingBackupSetupRepairFlow`. This flow guides the user through selecting the backup share and path, directly addressing the issue raised:

```python
class MissingBackupSetupRepairFlow(RepairsFlow):
    """Handler for an issue fixing flow."""
    # ...
    async def async_step_confirm(
        self, user_input: dict[str, str] | None = None
    ) -> data_entry_flow.FlowResult:
        """Handle the confirm step of a fix flow."""
        # ... form definition with CONF_BACKUP_SHARE and CONF_BACKUP_PATH
```

Other types of errors, such as authentication failures (`SYNOLOGY_AUTH_FAILED_EXCEPTIONS`) or connection errors (`SYNOLOGY_CONNECTION_EXCEPTIONS`), are handled by raising standard Home Assistant exceptions like `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` or `ConfigEntryNotReady`. These exceptions are processed by the Home Assistant config entry system, triggering built-in mechanisms like reauthentication flows or retries, rather than creating separate, potentially unfixable repair issues as per the rule's intent.

This selective use of repair issues only for user-fixable configuration problems (like the backup location) demonstrates adherence to the `repair-issues` rule.

## Suggestions

No suggestions needed. The integration correctly implements repair issues and flows for user-actionable problems and avoids them for issues the user cannot directly fix, aligning with the rule's requirements.
