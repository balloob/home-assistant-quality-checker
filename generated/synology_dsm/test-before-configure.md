## Overview

This rule requires that integrations connecting to external devices or services test the connection and authentication within the config flow before a configuration entry is successfully created. This helps users identify and troubleshoot issues like incorrect credentials or network problems early in the setup process.

The `synology_dsm` integration connects to a Synology NAS device, requiring network details and user credentials. Therefore, this rule is applicable.

The integration fully follows the `test-before-configure` rule. The `config_flow.py` file contains the necessary logic to validate the connection and authentication during the configuration flow.

Specifically, the `async_validate_input_create_entry` method, which is called by the various `async_step_` methods, performs the crucial validation. It instantiates the `synology_dsm.SynologyDSM` client with the user-provided input (host, port, username, password, SSL settings). It then calls the internal helper function `_login_and_fetch_syno_info`, which attempts to log in to the NAS and fetch initial data from core APIs like utilisation, storage, and network.

This interaction is wrapped in a `try...except` block that catches specific exceptions related to authentication (`SynologyDSMLoginInvalidException`, `SynologyDSMLogin2SARequiredException`, etc.) and connection issues (`SynologyDSMRequestException`, `SynologyDSMException`, `InvalidData`). If any of these exceptions occur, the corresponding error is set in the `errors` dictionary (`errors["base"] = "cannot_connect"`, `errors[CONF_USERNAME] = "invalid_auth"`, etc.), and the flow returns the form with the errors displayed using `self._show_form(step_id, user_input, errors)`.

The config entry is only created (`self.async_create_entry(...)`) after this initial connection and data fetching process within `_login_and_fetch_syno_info` completes without raising one of the caught exceptions (or after a successful 2FA step if required). This mechanism effectively tests the connection and authentication before finalizing the configuration entry, adhering to the rule.

## Suggestions

No suggestions needed. The integration correctly implements connection and authentication testing in its config flow.
