## Overview

The `appropriate-polling` rule requires integrations that poll devices or services to set an update interval suitable for how often the data is expected to change. This integration polls a local Synology DSM device for various data points. Therefore, the rule applies.

The `synology_dsm` integration utilizes `DataUpdateCoordinator` instances to manage polling, which is the recommended approach for modern Home Assistant integrations. Examining the `coordinator.py` file shows the following:

1.  **`SynologyDSMCentralUpdateCoordinator`**: This coordinator fetches general NAS information, storage, utilization, security, system, external USB, and upgrade status (`api.async_update`). In `coordinator.py`, this coordinator is initialized with an `update_interval` of `timedelta(minutes=15)`. This interval is appropriate as the data it fetches (CPU/RAM usage, disk space, temperature, system status, etc.) typically does not change rapidly.
2.  **`SynologyDSMSwitchUpdateCoordinator`**: This coordinator fetches Surveillance Station Home Mode status. In `coordinator.py`, it is initialized with an `update_interval` of `timedelta(seconds=30)`. While 30 seconds is more frequent than the central coordinator, Home Mode status could potentially be changed manually or triggered by Surveillance Station rules, necessitating a faster polling interval than 15 minutes to provide responsive automation triggers. 30 seconds is a reasonable balance for this type of state.
3.  **`SynologyDSMCameraUpdateCoordinator`**: This coordinator fetches camera status and stream sources. In `coordinator.py`, it is initialized with an `update_interval` of `timedelta(seconds=30)`. Similar to Home Mode, camera statuses (recording, enabled, motion detection) can change, justifying a more frequent poll than the central NAS stats.

The integration correctly avoids setting `_attr_should_poll = True` directly on entities derived from `CoordinatorEntity`, relying on the coordinator for updates as per best practices.

Overall, the integration employs polling with differentiated intervals based on the type of data being fetched, using suitably long intervals for slow-changing data (15 minutes for central stats) and slightly more frequent intervals for potentially faster-changing states (30 seconds for Surveillance Station). This demonstrates appropriate polling according to the rule's guidance.
