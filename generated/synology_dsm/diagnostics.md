## Overview

This rule requires integrations to implement a diagnostics reporting mechanism to help users and developers debug issues. This mechanism should gather relevant data about the integration's state and configuration, while ensuring that sensitive information is properly redacted.

The `synology_dsm` integration fully complies with this rule.

The integration provides a `diagnostics.py` file which implements the required `async_get_config_entry_diagnostics` function. This function retrieves data from the integration's `runtime_data` (specifically the `SynoApi` instance) and the config entry itself.

Crucially, the `diagnostics.py` file defines a `TO_REDACT` set containing `CONF_USERNAME`, `CONF_PASSWORD`, and `CONF_DEVICE_TOKEN`. The `async_get_config_entry_diagnostics` function then uses `async_redact_data` from `homeassistant.components.diagnostics` to redact these sensitive values from the `entry.as_dict()` output before including it in the diagnostics report.

The report includes detailed information about the DSM device, external USB devices, network interfaces, storage (disks and volumes), Surveillance Station cameras (including camera-specific diagnostics if available), DSM upgrade status, and utilization statistics. This provides a comprehensive overview useful for debugging.

While some potentially sensitive data like backup share paths (`CONF_BACKUP_SHARE`, `CONF_BACKUP_PATH` from `entry.options`) or external share names (`share_name` from `external_usb.partitions`) are included and not explicitly redacted, the rule primarily mandates redacting credentials, tokens, and location data. The implementation correctly handles the redaction of username, password, and device token as required by the rule's explicit requirements and examples.
